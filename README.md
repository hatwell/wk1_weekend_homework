### This is my weekend homework for my first week at CodeClan!

*  I completed the TDD section, including the optional questions. The integrated testing was challenging and I'm looking forward to going over it in class tomorrow.

*  I then decided to try to rewrite my code using OOP, so creating a PetShop class and initializing it using the "Camelot Pet Shop" data we were given.

*  This was fun and not too difficult until I got to trying to manage the customer variable. I decided to pause here and wait until the OOP classes start tomorrow!
